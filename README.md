# Splat

## Technology

The technologies I used were HTML, CSS, Javascript & jQuery.

### HTML & CSS

The HTML & CSS part of this project were straight forward. For the homepage I made a header for the title. For the main, I made a button to link the game page to the homepage. And last a footer.

### Javascript & jQuery

Javascript & jQuery was okay for me for this project. For this project I it was simple javascript and it was a click function and a win function. for the click function I made a conditional to check weather if its player red's turn or player blue's turn. In that conditional I said if its red's turn, add a class red to that div then I append a div to that class red to make the splat image to work. Then a did a long conditional to check for all rows, columns and diagonals to check who won, then lastly made a win function to check all those conditionals.

## My Approach

My approach to this project was thinking about tic-tac-toe. I made a tic-tac-toe game and for this I was thinking about making a larger scale of a tic-tac-toe game but with a paintball theme.

## Enjoy the game !
